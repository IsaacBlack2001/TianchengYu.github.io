Hi! I am Tiancheng Yu (俞天成, pronounced as Tea-en-chung Yoo). I am an undergraduate student majoring in [Physics](https://phy.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). 

During my undergraduate, I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Peng Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JQLol_0AAAAJ) at [International Center for Quantum Materials(ICQM)](http://icqm.pku.edu.cn/gyzx/gyzx_gyzx/index.htm), Peking University. Currently I am also a visiting research student at [School of Engineering and Applied Science(SEAS)](https://seas.harvard.edu/), Harvard University, supervised by [Prof. Xin Li](https://scholar.harvard.edu/lixin).

My research interest includes electrode materials, grain boundaries in 2D materials and 4D-STEM.

        Nanobeam Four-Dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D-STEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing the crystal structure of a diverse range of nanomaterials. Facing the large and unlabeled 4D-STEM datasets, unsupervised machine learning has been employed to uncover hidden patterns based on the similarities between diffractions.  However, the diffraction intensity variances caused by unrelated features including the lattice mistilt and dynamic scattering effects can dominate the similarity and hinder the performance of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigated a new pre-transformation strategy for 4D datasets  by combining  the cepstrum transformation and manifold learning to extract relevant lattice features with physical meanings such as strain profile, lattice orientation and domain structures, thereby enhancing unsupervised machine learning performance. The effectiveness of our methods is rigorously validated using both simulated and experimental datasets encompassing various materials, including 2D ferroelectric materials and nanoparticles. These data transformation techniques hold significant promise as integral components of automated 4D-STEM processing workflows, facilitating efficient and precise characterization of nanostructured materials.
